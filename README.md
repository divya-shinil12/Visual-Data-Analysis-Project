# Visual-Data-Analysis-Project
This project used the visualization tools to analyze the road accidents happening in India from 1970 to 2019. After analyzing the data, it shows there was large increase in the number of accidents from 1970 to 2010. After 2010, the data shows a slight decrease in the count of accidents until 2019. But the number of deaths is increasing every year. To reduce the number of accidents and deaths, various factors were analyzed to understand the significant causes of road accidents, thereby helping to take measures to save the lives of people.

**#Data**:
The dataset is downloaded from https://data.gov.in/catalog/road-accidents-india-2019. The information is provided by Indian Government (Ministry of Road Trans-portation) on their official website, which include all the details regarding road traffic accidents from the period 1970 to 2019. The data includes all the details of accidents happened in India as well as in each states and Union Territories. There are total count of accidents that happened, a count of injured and deaths caused due to road accidents, weather conditions, people’s gender, and age, types of vehicles increasing the severity of accidents, etc.

**#Research questions or hypothesis**:
• Trend of accidents happening all over India from 1970 to 2019 and also comparing different factors leading to road accidents nationally and in each states and union territories.
• What are the major causes of road accidents in India?
• Is weather an important factor for road accidents?
• Which type of vehicles encounter more accidents and cause fatalities?
• Does our health care system helps to decrease the fatalities in urban and rural areas of India?
• Age and Gender of people involved in road accidents and which gender is most affected?

The visualizing of data helps for the better understanding of data and finding insights that will help to measure the severity of accidents, which indeed helps to take measures to prevent road accidents in India. Once data is prepared, we can visualize the data. Here, I have used a bar chart, stacked bar chart, Heatmap, pie chart, spider chart, scrollable bar chart, and map.
